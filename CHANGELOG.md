## [Unreleased]


## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-29

### Changed

- Bump the `hotdata-framework` floor to `>=0.5.0` and the `hotdata` SDK to `0.5.0`. Framework 0.5.0 is backward compatible (additive-only: an optional `format` field on `LoadManagedTableRequest` and an optional `format` parameter on `ResultsApi.get_result`), so no source changes were required; the full test suite passes.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-06-27

### Changed

- Release 0.2.2

## [0.2.1] - 2026-06-22

### Changed

- Pin `hotdata-framework` to `>=0.3.0` (adds the typed-error API:
  `HotdataError`/`HotdataTransientError`/`HotdataTerminalError`/`classify_sdk_error`).
  No code adoption was required: this package has no SDK error-handling call sites — its
  runtime calls are thin pass-throughs exposed as LangChain `StructuredTool`s, which let
  exceptions propagate to the LangChain runtime by design.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-22

### Changed

- Upgrade `hotdata` SDK pin to `>=0.4.1` and `hotdata-framework` to `>=0.2.4`.
- Raise `langchain-core` floor to `>=1.0` (verified against the test suite).

### Added

- Ruff and mypy tooling configuration in `pyproject.toml`, plus `ruff` and `mypy`
  dev dependencies. Applied `ruff check --fix` and `ruff format` cleanup across the
  codebase.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-01

### Changed

- Release 0.1.1

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-19

### Added

- Initial release with LangChain tools for Hotdata managed databases.
